The "Music Player" project is a lightweight multimedia player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, styled to resemble the Windows 10 Media Player interface. The application offers basic music playback functionalities, queue management, and UI personalization through themes and accent colors.
## Features
* Modern Interface: Clean and intuitive design inspired by Windows 10 Media Player.
* Audio Playback: Supports MP3 files with full playback control (play/pause, next/previous track, volume adjustment, progress bar).
* Queue Management: Add multiple audio files to a playback queue and clear it when needed.
* Data Persistence: Utilizes IndexedDB to store the playback queue and user settings (theme, accent color), ensuring data is retained across application restarts.
Personalization:
* Themes: Switch between dark and light modes.
* Accent Colors: Choose from several predefined accent colors that dynamically change the interface's appearance.
* Home Page with Version Info: A newly added "Home" section that displays the current application version and a list of introduced changes and improvements.
* Responsive Design: Basic adaptability to various screen sizes (desktop, mobile).
## Planned Enhancements
* Community Themes / Custom CSS Loading: Allow users to download the default style.css file, modify it, and then upload their custom version to be used by the application, enabling community-contributed themes.
* Shuffle and repeat playback modes.
* Integration with APIs for fetching album art and metadata.
